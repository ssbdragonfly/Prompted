# Prompted

A fun AI prompt guessing game where you try to figure out what prompt was used to generate AI text.

## Overview

Prompted is an interactive game that challenges your understanding of AI and prompt engineering. The game shows you AI-generated content and asks you to guess what prompt was used to create it. After submitting your guess, you'll see how close you were to the actual prompt using a complicated mathematical similarity metric. Thank you to [HackClub](https://hackclub.com) for making this possible.
