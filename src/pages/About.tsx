          <p className="mb-4">
            AI is increasingly becoming part of our daily lives: in our devices, our homes, and throughout society. 
            As these systems become more integrated into our world, the ability to effectively communicate with and understand AI 
            is becoming an important skill for navigating our digital landscape.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>prompted</strong> is an agreggated set of resources and a game designed to help you think about AI literacy.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Beyond Prompt Engineering</h3>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            While learning to craft effective prompts certainly helps get better AI outputs, I believe the implications extend further:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Environmental Consideration:</strong> More efficient prompting can reduce computational 
              resources used, potentially lessening the environmental impact of our AI interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Equitable Access:</strong> When fewer tokens achieve better results, 
              AI becomes more accessible to those with limited resources or bandwidth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Human-AI Partnership:</strong> Clear communication with AI systems helps them 
              better serve human needs rather than creating friction in our workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Understanding how AI interprets language encourages us to 
              evaluate AI-generated content more thoughtfully and consider the ethical dimensions of these technologies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">The Art of Prompting</h3>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Prompting sits somewhere between programming and conversation, it's a new form of communication 
            with its own patterns and principles. It combines precision with creativity, structure with exploration.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Playing <strong>prompted</strong> is just one small way to develop an intuition for this emerging form of expression. 
            Through play, we can begin to see the connections between human intention and machine output.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">A Personal Exploration</h3>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>prompted</strong> isn't meant to be definitive or comprehensive, it's simply my contribution to an ongoing conversation 
            about how we interact with AI systems. For me, it's a starting point for thinking about the language we use with machines 
            and how that shapes what we receive in return.
          </p>

          </p>
          
          <p className="mt-6">
            As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, I believe developing our vocabulary and understanding of these systems 
            helps us maintain agency in our increasingly digital world.
